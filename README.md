# Port-Scanner
Bash script that takes a target IP address as input and scans for open ports on the target using the nmap tool.

To use the script, simply save it to a file (e.g. portscanner.sh) and make it executable using chmod +x portscanner.sh. Then, run the script with the target IP address as an argument, like so:
./portscanner.sh 192.168.1.1	
This will scan the IP address 192.168.1.1 for open ports and display the results.
